# Classifying Handwritten Digits
It's a Kaggle competition for Machine Learning Data Science (CS5780).

Background: You are provided 10000 1084-dimensionality feature vectors based on 10000 hand written digits (from '0' - '9'), a similarity graph with 6000 nodes (the first 6000 data points) where two nodes are connected if they are similar, and 60 labeled examples that 6 example data-points for each digit.

Goal: For the last 4000 handwritten digits, predict what the corresponding label from '0' to '9' is.

Implement: run code.R
